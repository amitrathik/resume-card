RSCARD HTML Template
-- Uses Bootstrap 3 (i think)
-- Uses Jquery

Goal is to bundle assets with webpack and setup development environment so I can refactor with ES6 code, refactor template into web components (independent of JS framework/library (react, vue, jquery, angular)).. maybe create snippets or examples of each library with this project




A personal website serving as a virtual resume & business card. 
It is also serving as a sandbox for me to continuing practicing to expand my web development skills. 

Purchased an HTML template, RSCard by PX Lab (a few years ago) and really struggled with decision making overload. Reverse engineer the code using the template as a reference guide, or just using the template as a framework. This really kept me stuck in a loop for a while getting nothing started, but starting over and second guessing myself.

My main reason was I didn't want to get stuck with an approach, and also wanted to portray my ability to be versatile as a developer. But, I have learned from that and deciding to work with the template as a framework to get started.

Some changes I will make initally is refactoring the code into reusable components.
